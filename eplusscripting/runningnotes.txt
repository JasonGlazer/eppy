I think d_newread.py is working. 
Reads idd only once.
    from fhandle and filename
put idd in a module and try to do pytests with that, reading the idd only once.

IIDF now reads idd only once
it works with iddfilename, but not with iddfilehandle :-(
see d_newread.py
compare theidd (from readidf.readdatacommdct) in d_newread.py and d_filehandle.py

- IDF.setiddname(fhandle)
    this is failing because, fhandle is getting exhausted
    fhandle should get used only once. - how to do this ?
moke the pipe objects.
check if a new object can be made with named arguments. DONE
- fix the pytest that read a file

when you rename nodes do:
obj.nodefield = [oldnodename, newodename]
Then you can find the occurance of the old names in other places.

node rename
- exception at loop endpoints.
- How to identify them.
updatebranch(loop, branch, [c1, c2, c3, c4])
getinletname(loop, branch, c1) -> maybe None
getoutletname(loop, branch, c1) -> maybe None
do standard node name change
If None:
    replace that nodename
else:
    pass

branch
[] -> [p0]

[p0] -> [p1]
[p0] -> [p0, p1]
[p0] -> [p1, p0]

[p0, p1] -> [pn, p1]
[p0, p1] -> [p0, pn]
[p0, p1] -> [pn, p0, p1]
[p0, p1] -> [p0, p1, pn]
[p0, p1, p2] -> [p0, pn, p1, p2]

OR

replace the contents of the branch with a new list of components
[pump, chiller, coil] -> these items are EpBunch objects.
two options:
- rename all the nodes logically. 
    - 
    Problem is that nodes may be referred to at the controls.
